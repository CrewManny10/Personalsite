        <h1> About Me</h1>

        <p>
            I recently graduated from Boston College with a degree in Computer Science and a Minor in Management and Leadership.
             My passion for sports, combined with my experience as a student-athlete, has instilled in me qualities
             such as hard work, determination, resilience, and patience.
            These attributes have not only contributed to my academic success but have also shaped my role as a mentor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking ahead, my aspiration is to pursue a career as a Software Engineer once I complete my formal education.
        </p>
