Step: 1
    I begin the application by getting an access key to use 
OMDBA API, which stands for Open Movie Database(free open API, provides vast amount of information about movies and tv shows).

Step: 2 
    Created a postman account to play with the API to see if it actually work, resulting in a JSON page.

Step: 3 
    The fun starts. Set up react

Step: 4
    In the app.js file created a state object to hold the list of the movies. later will be coming from the API.
